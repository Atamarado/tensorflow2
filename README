Project made by @Atamarado github.com/Atamarado

This repository aims to contain and save all the code that I write to learn Machine Learning using package Tensorflow
2.x, designed in Python. Because of that, note that in most cases, the code won't be as perfect as it could
be, but that's part of the process of learning, I think.

You can also note that most of the code also isn't properly documented. I'll do my best to give proper
comments and documentation to projects when I understand new things. Some of the comments of the code
would be in Spanish also :(.

Feel free to use the code if it's useful to you. I'll appreciate a little mention to my github in the final
code, and a star to this project.

The project have 3 folders:
    /src/:      Contains all the projects, enumerated from 000 to 999, ordered by creation date.
    /.idea/:    Pycharm Project files.
    /venv/:     Virtual environment (necessary to compile the code)
